  <div class="top">Ilst. The capitol of the kingdom of Rolstavillian last in contention to the High Throne who's king Rolst Ilstavillian, current ruler and King west of the Great River was a usurper of a forgotten house who's name was magically erased from all memory in all the land. Early on Ilst contended to be a challenge to the throne after the kingdom was split in two by Krieg the Scourge. The carnage of the two monster wars of the last centuries and decades of civil war between the three kingdoms has left most of Rolst desolate an in ruin. Its borders stretch from the northwest coast to the Fence Mountain range to the south and west of the Great River to the shores of the Dread Sea. Rolstavillian lands host a great plains where reside the native human plains folk in the Endless Grass. The mating of the people of Rolst with the native plains folk shortly after the sundering of Azhalis produced the Horse Lords, their prowess was seen in many campaigns during Monster War Two.</div>
