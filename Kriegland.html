  <div class="top">Kriegstier to the south many leagues away lies Kriegland with its Capitol Kriegstier thriving as a slightly smaller version of its counterpart in the north. Lord Kragen became Krieg the Scourge during Roland the Seconds reign and split the kingdom in two. His great grand sire Lord Krieg the IV is current ruler of the southern kingdom and lead contender to the High Throne of The Three Kingdoms. Kriegland encompasses the southeastern corner of Azhalis and boasts to contain all the land between the south eastern coast to the south western coast including the Fence. Its influence is strongly felt in Soladaarn and in the Southern Darklands to the far west Voltralla falls marks the western border of Maetyrs "allowance" to Krieg.    </div>
